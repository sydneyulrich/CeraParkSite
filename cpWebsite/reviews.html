    <p class="review" id="review1">Cera Park is a wonderful campground! We camped there many nights when our kids were
        little. We also
        camped there this summer! Very well taken care of! Thank you to everyone on the board for keeping it going every
        year.

    <p class="review" id="review2">It was my first time going to Cera Park. My grandkids really liked it. I love the
        idea of having
        three sizes of pools. That's awesome. Definitely going back. <br><br> -Magdalena</p>
    <p class="review" id="review3">Great spot to camp! Clean with decent facilities! Swimming pool is great for the
        family to enjoy.
        Friendly, responsive staff too. Sites are reasonably level with fire rings and picnic tables, 30 amp service.

    <p class="review" id="review4">Cera Park is a good place to camp, and they have direct access to the river. There
        are several boat
        landings and the water is shallow for over 200 yards. It's a good place to take a canoe out on the river.
